    "bio": "I'm Katherine Sprague, better known as Kate, and I'm so glad you're here! \n\n I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for mindfulness. My favorite color is ðŸ–¤, but you'll catch me with ðŸŒˆ's on my attire regularly. They just make me so happy! \n\n Outside of engineering my favorite past time is traveling and eating all the food. I'm always looking for the next place to explore in the world and am the happiest with my friends by my side. In my free time you can find me hanging with my family, practicing yoga, running(or contemplating running), and obssessing over positive reinforcement dog training. Ask me about my dog who needs all the training! \n\n Until Coding Bootcamp my main focus was being the biggest cheerleader to my family and friends. I did everything I could to make sure that those around me were loved, supported and reaching their goals. Seeing the ones I love succeed was my passion. Part of that journey was co-owning a successful photography business with my husband over the past 14 years. Not too long ago I decided to start cheering myself on and work toward a career and a life that I was fulfilled in, proud of, and excited to share with my people. \n\n This process of finding myself led me to software engineering. The start of that journey was spent self-learning followed by being accepted into an immersive engineering bootcamp. As I learn and grow I'm thrilled to have this new outlet to apply my skills and creativity. \n\n I'm beyond excited to see where I go from here as I find my place in the tech community. My hope is to always stay mindful of what I'm working on and who I'm working with. With intentionality we are at our best. \n\n I hope you've enjoyed learning a bit about me.
