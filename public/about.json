    "bio": "I'm glad you're here! I'm Katherine Sprague (better known as Kate). \n I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for mindfulness. My favorite color is ðŸ–¤black, but you'll catch me with rainbows on my attire regularly. they just make me so happy!ðŸŒˆ \n\n I spent my adult life until this year being the biggest cheerleader to my family and friends. I did all the necessary thing to make sure that those around me were supported and reaching their goals. Not too long ago I decided to start cheering myself on and work toward a career and a life that I was fulfilled in, proud of, and excited to share with my people. \n\n This process of finding myself led me to software engineering. Many hours of research had me choosing the General assembly software engineering immersive program as my way to build a base of knowledge that I could easily expand after bootcamp. I build this site as i prepare to head onto the next phase of the journey - the job hunt! \n\n I'm beyond excited to see where I go from here as I find my place in the tech community. My hope is to always stay mindful of what I'm working on and who I'm working with. I think with intentionality we are at our best. I hope you've enjoyed learning a bit about me. Please reach out if you'd like to chat!"
